**STUDY NOTES**

<img align="right" width="150" height="200" src="/image/laptop.jpg">

Relative Speed Numbers Every Programmer Should Know:

              |
             / \
            / | \         CPU = 0.4 ns
              |           RAM = 100 ns
              |           SSD Storage = 16 µs
              |           Network = 150 ms

Orders of Size (time) [3]:

               1 ns = 0,000 001 ms
               1 ms = 1,000,000 ns
