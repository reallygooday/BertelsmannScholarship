      - I'm extremely lucky and honored to have received an acceptance into the Udacity Technology Scholarship powered by Bertelsmann. I'm very thankful for the opportunity I have been given.
______
______

      Bertelsmann is the German media and services multinational corporation. Worldwide the company has almost 350 locations. It was founded as a publishing house by Carl Bertelsmann in 1835._
______


_More than 45,000 people from all over the world applied for the Scholarship. 15,000 recipients are participating in the First Phase. Top passionate, motivated and resilient scholars from the initial Challenge will earn one of 1,600 full scholarships to the Nanodegree program. The announcement of round two scholarship recipients will be on March 18, 2020._

_My name is Angela, and I am a novice in Cloud Computing. I have been selected for the first round of the Udacity technology scholarship program powered by Bertelsmann. The first round gives a chance to qualify for a full 6-month Scholarship. In the First Phase I work to complete Udacity Foundational course in the field of Cloud. I don't have access to LINUX distribution, but I use the default command line, bash version 3.2.57(1)-release in OS X on Apple system, MacBook Pro with macOS Catalina Version 10.15.1._

_***A little about me.*** Passionate about helping people, I started nursing at the edge of 18. I studied the various branches of medical science at the Klaipeda Medical School in Lithuania and was hired immediately as the youngest Oncology Nurse. After helping cancer patients for 10 years in Lithuania, I decided to take a leap of faith and moved to London on a student visa. After 19 years in the UK, I built a new technical skill set._

_I work as a corporate receptionist. I am a part of the team for Vodafone Data Centre and am involved in many other companies. My interest in computing began while studying games programming at the University of Westminster and has grown since then. I have maintained a fascination with technology from the start. My favorite application to date has been creating style transfer by utilizing Deep Learning written in Python. I plan to contunue persuing my interest in growing technologies._

The Lesson 1 addresses `shell scripting`. The shell is directly linked to the kernel. Terminal is an interface to shell.( On the Mac the Terminal Program is in the Applications/Utilities folder.)

Shell:
- [x] graphical GUI;
- [x] text CLI.

5 Most Popular Shells for Linux[5]:
 - [1] Bash (Mac and Linux computers use the BASH shell by default);
 - [2] Tcsh;

Started working within Linux virtual machine and following guidance from "Configuring Linux Web Servers" Udacity course [2]. 


When visiting website browser is requesting a number of files that located on a server. Usually, that server is running Linux. Linux is the most popular OS for web servers. Some estimates say 80% of public Internet servers are rumnning Linux. 

Downloaded and installed VirtualBox. This is free software that will run the virtual machine.
Downloaded and instaledl Vagrant. This is an command line utility that makes it easy to manage and access your virtual machines.
Note: Currently (July 2018), the version of VirtualBox is 5.2. Newer versions do not yet support Vagrant.

Working from command line only.
Coded using the following command:

     > $cd ~/Documents
     > $cd vm
     > $ls -a (-a flag used to list all hiden files, on a Linux system, any file that begins with a dot is considered a hidden file)
     > $ls -al (-l flag lists results in long format; d is a directory, -dash is a file)

I'm logged into a Linux virtual machine.

    Current machine states:

    default                   running (virtualbox)

    The VM is running. To stop this VM, you can run `vagrant halt` to
    shut it down forcefully, or you can run `vagrant suspend` to simply
    suspend the virtual machine. In either case, to restart it again,
    simply run `vagrant up`.

 - [x] Finished Setup AWS Free Tier Account.
    
       _AWS Free Tier is a great option to get access to AWS products for no cost. Anyone can use the product for free up to specified   limits for one year from the date the account was created. This includes 750 hours of Amazon EC2 Linux t2.micro instance usage, 5 GB of Amazon S3 standard storage, 750 hours of Amazon RDS Single-AZ db.t2.micro Instances, one million AWS Lambda requests and you can build and host most Alexa skills for free._


- [x] Attended London Study Group meet up at the British Library, discussed an AWS project with Mohamed Hassona and Enrico Mengotti.

![](/image/library_gif.gif)


- [x] Registered for AWS event in London on Wednesday, 22 January, 2020, for Amazon Web Services (AWS) re:Invent re:Cap Public Sector Edition.

   
- [x] Read an article on Quora [9]:

      "AWS-S3

      You’ll quickly run out of free tier if you use EC2 of S3 excessively.

      Intra region/zone data transfer - this is where you run out of quota very quickly.

      Do not upload large test files to S3 from your desktop - generate them on free EC2 instance and then upload. Same AZ transfer will incur no charges.

      Do not leave any publicly accessible S3 buckets.

      DynamoDB

      Do not create tables in DynamoDB with high read/write through-output (keep defaults). If you created high through-output test table delete it asap otherwise you’ll incur monthly charge.

      EC2

      If you attach EBS to your instance - even if you stop your instance later or terminate it still with be on your balance sheet.

      You’ll have to delete it using AWS console.

      UPDATE: If you deal with large datasets on daily basis - check out these ad-hoc tools for Oracle and AWS.

      oracletools/table-hunter-for-oracle - Win OS spooler
       pydemo/Snowpipe-For-SQLServer - Pipe your data from SQL Server to Snowflake."
